    <i>The Dialectical Porn Rock</i> began in 1989 as a practical joke. Yet as often happens with jokes, much had been condensed into a single gesture. I was spending the summer in the mountains, away from my studio in New York. A friend, who is a sculptor and an avid fisherman, was also vacationing there. He had been using pornographic photos in his work. I planned to surprise him by planting rocks covered with pictures of naked bodies in his favorite trout stream. Taking rocks from the stream, I pasted on photos torn from magazines, then brushed on a protective layer of polyester resin, and put them back in the water. Struck by the contrast between the altered rocks and their natural setting, I decided to photograph them. Only later, did I appreciate the rocks as objects in themselves and started to arrange them outdoors and indoors both in carefully laid out forms and random piles. I titled the series of sculptural installations and photographs <i>The Dialectical Porn Rock</i> after Robert Smithson's essay "The Dialectical Landscape".  I photographed the rocks in a variety of urban and rural landscapes throughout New York, California, the Southwest, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. </p>
